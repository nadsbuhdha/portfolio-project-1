![Alt Text](assets/images/multiple-platforms.webp)


Can’t stop won’t stop studios is a specialist musician website that aims to offer a recording, rehearsal, mixing and mastering studio for musicians of varying abilities and ranges based in Nottingham. With ever growing accessibility of music hardware and software, ‘bedroom producers’ have become ever present; whereby musicians record, perform and create music within the confines of their own house. Whilst becoming ever popular, ‘Bedroom producing’ has its limitations such as: equipment space, sound quality, lack of support, sound acoustics and a variety of other issues. Music studios are therefore still an important cog in the musicians’ wheel. Can’t stop won’t stop studios aims to provide a space where musicians can bring skeleton ideas to finish off to achieve a professional sound, or create brand new musical ideas from scratch. Throughout the website, the aim is to showcase the studio, the equipment, the abilities in the studio and give musicians and idea of what they can expect should they book a session.

## Colour Schemes 

Dark UI was chosen for the colour scheme of the website.

Darker tones are more relevant to the websites branding. Dark colours in the navigation and footer contrast well with the images displayed across the site. 

The navigation bar and the footer featured the colour: #19181a
The navigation and footer links across the site featured the colour: #D83fe7
A sleek purple which contrasted well with the dark navigation and footer, giving a professional look. 

## Fonts 

Open sans was used for the heading fonts. Open sans is recommended for its legibility, high readability, and friendly appearance. Sans-serif was utilised as a back-up font. 

Monserrat was chosen for the main body text. A clean and sophisticated font, it was recommended by google fonts to compliment Open Sans. San Serif was also used as a back-up font. 

## Wireframes 

Balsamiq was utilised to create wireframes of the website. Idea templates were mocked up in order to develop an idea of how elements of the websites would work across different platforms and how responsive elements may look resized.
