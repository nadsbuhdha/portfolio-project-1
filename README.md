# Can't Stop Wont Stop Studios

![Alt Text](assets/images/multiple-platforms.webp)


Can’t stop won’t stop studios is a specialist musician website that aims to offer a recording, rehearsal, mixing and mastering studio for musicians of varying abilities and ranges based in Nottingham. With ever growing accessibility of music hardware and software, ‘bedroom producers’ have become ever present; whereby musicians record, perform and create music within the confines of their own house. Whilst becoming ever popular, ‘Bedroom producing’ has its limitations such as: equipment space, sound quality, lack of support, sound acoustics and a variety of other issues. Music studios are therefore still an important cog in the musicians’ wheel. Can’t stop won’t stop studios aims to provide a space where musicians can bring skeleton ideas to finish off to achieve a professional sound, or create brand new musical ideas from scratch. Throughout the website, the aim is to showcase the studio, the equipment, the abilities in the studio and give musicians and idea of what they can expect should they book a session.

## User expectations

As there is a specific target audience, musicians, for this website the following user expectations were considered when creating the site:

*	The site is simple clear and easy to use. 
*	The structure is logical and obvious.
*	The site is responsive and users can expect to see the same content on different devices without a reduction in quality. 
*	The media content included on the site is relevant and meaningful to the services provided

## Colour Schemes 

Dark UI was chosen for the colour scheme of the website. Generally, studios are low light environments and often synonymous with night-time and after-hours usage, therefore the darker colour tones were utilised to represent that. Darker tones are more relevant to the websites branding. Dark colours in the navigation and footer contrast well with the images displayed across the site. 

The navigation bar and the footer featured the colour: #19181a
The navigation and footer links across the site featured the colour: #D83fe7
A sleek purple which contrasted well with the dark navigation and footer, giving a professional look. 

## Fonts 

Open sans was used for the heading fonts. Open sans is recommended for its legibility, high readability, and friendly appearance. Sans-serif was utilised as a back-up font. 

Monserrat was chosen for the main body text. A clean and sophisticated font, it was recommended by google fonts to compliment Open Sans. San Serif was also used as a back-up font. 

## Wireframes 

Balsamiq was utilised to create wireframes of the website. Idea templates were mocked up in order to develop an idea of how elements of the websites would work across different platforms and how responsive elements may look resized.

As evidenced, there is significant accessibility across the website on both mobile and desktop devices. The use of alt attributes and contrasting colours were utilised to achieve this. 
The website performance was moderately downgraded on mobile devices. This is due to the use of images in the gallery section. Whilst the images were optimised for size, they still had a minor impact on mobile site performance.


## Bugs

### solved bugs

* When I initally ran the HTML code through the validator, a stray div was highlighted. This was quickly resolved. 

![Alt Text](assets/images/straydiv.webp)

* A HTML validator error occurred during testing due to the imbedded iframe. The frameborder="0" caused the error and once removed, the error was solved.

* When testing on the Ipad Pro, the home page did not have enough content to stretch its height to fit to the bottom of the page. This was solved with a media query which increased the height on the sections and divs once a minimum height was reached. 

![Alt Text](assets/images/ipadtest.png)

* When tested on mobile devices, the hover effect utilised on the gallery was not operational. In order to solve this an 'on:click' javascript element was added which allows users to tap images on the gallery to reveal the information. 

* During testing, it was noticed that the gallery page nav bar would break due to the size of the image gallery. A max-width of 900px was used in order to solve this bug.
