![Alt Text](assets/images/multiple-platforms.webp)


Can’t stop won’t stop studios is a specialist musician website that aims to offer a recording, rehearsal, mixing and mastering studio for musicians of varying abilities and ranges based in Nottingham. With ever growing accessibility of music hardware and software, ‘bedroom producers’ have become ever present; whereby musicians record, perform and create music within the confines of their own house. Whilst becoming ever popular, ‘Bedroom producing’ has its limitations such as: equipment space, sound quality, lack of support, sound acoustics and a variety of other issues. Music studios are therefore still an important cog in the musicians’ wheel. Can’t stop won’t stop studios aims to provide a space where musicians can bring skeleton ideas to finish off to achieve a professional sound, or create brand new musical ideas from scratch. Throughout the website, the aim is to showcase the studio, the equipment, the abilities in the studio and give musicians and idea of what they can expect should they book a session.
